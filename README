This is an automated testing suite.

Usage:
  ruby run.rb [options] program_1 [program2] suite


program_1 : The executable that is to be tested.
program_2 : The executable that program_1 is to be tested against
suite     : A Directory of test input files.
options   : 
    -a : Passes the content of the input files as arguments to the program(s).
         Default behaviour is to pass the contents of the files through standard in.
    --help : Show help
    -h : alias for --help


If two executables are provided, the runSuite compare their output when passing them both any .in files found in the suite directory.

If only one executable is provided then the runSuite expects the suite directory to contain both .in and .out files. [file_name].in will be passed to the executable and it's output will be compared with [file_name].out.


`gem install rainbow` to get coloured output. (optional)
