This is an automated testing suite.

Usage:
  run [options] program_1 [program2] suite


program_1 : The executable that is to be tested.
program_2 : The executable that program_1 is to be tested against
suite     : A directory of test input files.
options   : 
    -a : Passes the content of the input files as arguments to the    
         program(s). Default behaviour is to pass the contents of the 
         files through standard in.


run (--help, -h) : Display this readme
run update : update runSuite from git

If two executables are provided, the runSuite will compare their output when 
both are passed each .in file found in the suite directory.

If .out files exist in the suite directory, they will be used instead of the 
second program's output. (This is useful when testing cases where you expect 
your program's output to differ from that of the second program.)

If only one executable is provided then the runSuite expects the suite 
directory to contain both .in and .out files. [file_name].in will be 
passed to the executable and it's output will be compared with
[file_name].out.

Make the command global by adding this line to your bash_profile:
  export PATH="/path/to/runSuite/:$PATH"

`gem install rainbow` to get coloured output. (optional)
