This is an automated testing suite.


Program Vs. Program
Usage: 
  ruby runPVP.rb [ options ] program_1 program_2 test_suite_directory

  Arguments:
    1 - First executable program
    2 - Second executable program
    3 - A directory of test input files (currently for argument input, stdin option to come soon)

  options:
    -a : The file names in your test suite directory will be individually passed as arguments to the programs.
         By default the contents of each file is passed.
    -i : The test file will be passed to each program through standard input.


Program Vs. files
Usage:
  ruby run.rb [ options ] program test_suite_directory

  The test suite directory should contain files with the extensions .in and .out
  The .in files will be fed to the program via stdin, and the output of the program will be checked against the .out file.

  options:
    -a : The .in file names in your test suite directory will be passed as arguments to the program. By default they are read through stdin.

`gem install rainbow` to get coloured output. (optional)
